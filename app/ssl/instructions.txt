How to install

In order to prevent the browser from showing the SSL security warning, the .crt file needs to be added to your local Trusted Certificate Store.

On Windows
-- Run "mmc" - right-click the Windows icon on the task bar, and click the "Run" selection. This will open the management console to import the Certificate
-- Select "Certificates"
   -- File
   -- Add/Remove Snap-ins...
   -- Select "Certificates" in the left pane
   -- Click "Add"
   -- Select "Computer Account"
   -- Click Next, then Finish, then click Ok
-- Expand the Certificates item in the tree view on the left
   -- Expand "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
   -- Select the "Certificates" folder - you should see a list of certificates installed on your machine
   -- Right-click the "Certificates" folder and choose "All Tasks" then "Import"
   -- "Local Machine" should be selected, click "Next"
   -- Browse to the /ssl folder in the root of the Angular app and choose the .crt file
   -- The "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" selection should be chosen, click Next
   -- Click "Finish" - the certificate will be added to your local certificate Store

That's it!

Now when you run the Angular app, enter the https://... and the sites should be secure.


On Mac
Unfortunately I don't have the instructions for installing the certificate on a Mac but I'm sure there are instructions on the web for this.
